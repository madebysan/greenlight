export const POSTER_CONCEPTS_PROMPT = `Generate a Poster Concepts document from this screenplay data. This is a creative exploration document — generate MANY diverse ideas for movie poster designs. Quantity and variety matter more than perfection. The user will iterate on favorites.

Before writing, silently classify the film's creative lane from the JSON and choose poster language that belongs to that lane:
- intimate drama / romance: negative space, distance, city texture, rooms, thresholds, screens, hands, reflected lives
- horror / thriller: ordinary space turning unsafe, one clue, controlled gaze, social surface, ritual, threat
- historical / court / satire: status tableau, costume, rank, appetite, animals/props, ceremonial rooms, private leverage
- sci-fi / action / epic: scale, systems, vehicles, combat, ritual, environmental pressure, worldbuilding
- family / fable / magical realism: central object behavior, child-eye view, public rules, simple wonder, sky/street geometry

Do not reuse one generic concept set for every film. Avoid stock concepts like "The Power Structure", "The Hero Object", "The Main Location as Pressure", or taglines like "Power changes hands" unless the JSON specifically supports that wording. Make the concept names feel born from this screenplay.

Format your output as clean markdown:
